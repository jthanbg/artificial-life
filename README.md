An artificial life simulator that uses interactions of attraction and repulsion between colored particles.
Inside the given HTML file is the code that dictates the attraction and repulsion of the particles, as well as the quantity of particles that can be spawned. Tweak the values to your desire and see what happens :)
(SPAWNING MORE THAN 200 PARTICLES WILL MAKE THE SIMULATION LAGGY)
