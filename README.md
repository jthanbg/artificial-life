An artificial life simulator that generates 200 particles in an enclosed box. There are three distinct types of particles (red, green and yellow) that are affected by an inverse square law (like gravity) that attracts certain colors and repels others. The settings on the strength of attraction and repulsion, along with the amount of particles generated and their colors, can be changed in the code. I left settings that generate a moving "creature". The amount of particles that can be generated before the page starts lagging depends on your PC and the fact that this was programmed in JavaScript.
